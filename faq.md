## ⭐ General {#general}

::: tip
The following questions apply to all users. Scroll further down for issues specfic to either Windows or Mac systems.
:::

### 1. Unable to access Dirar.li. e.g friend, or different device {#dns}

If the site shows as a blank page or says it cannot be reached, set your DNS to 1.1.1.1 following the instructions below.

Windows: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/windows/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/windows/)
 Mac: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/macos/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/macos/)

You may also fix the issue with [WARP](https://one.one.one.one/) - quicker, though must be enabled any time you visit the site.

### 2. Unable to access Pixeldrain {#pixeldrain}

Pixeldrain is blocked in Italy amongst certain ISP, simply download using the GoFile mirror.

### 3. Is [plugin] compatible with my After Effects version? {#pluginversion}

The majority of plugins available will work on any standard version of After Effects (2020+). Scripts and extensions will vary; look into their developer notes.

### 4. How can I resolve "This unlicensed Adobe app will be disabled"? {#gcc}

This alert is fairly common and easily fixable.[**Click here**](gcc) to learn how to remove it.

### 5. What will happen if I switch After Effects versions? {#swap}

[**Click here**](versionswapguide) to learn how you can make a smooth transition when upgrading versions without losing any of your plugins or presets. It's easier than you might think.

### 6. What are plugins and which ones should I download? {#plugins}

[**Click here**](beginnersguide#what-are-plugins-and-which-ones-should-i-get) for starter recommendations. Ultimately, it entirely depends on your style.

### 7. Which version of After Effects should I get? {#version}

The newest version (features) is always worth getting as long as you have enough RAM and a good CPU, [**click here for more information.**](beginnersguide#which-version-of-after-effects-should-i-get)

### 8. Can I download cracked plugins despite having a legitimate copy? {#legitimate}

Yes. Why are you paying for it though? XD

### 9. There is a watermark when I use a plugin? {#watermarked}

A watermark, typically a red X means that whatever plugin you're using is unlicensed. This indicates you did not install it properly. Make sure to properly read the instructions or refer to our support server for assistance.

### 10. My software says it can be updated. Should I click accept? {#update}

No, these are official pop-ups. The software will no longer be licensed if you do so.

### 11. I have duplicate effects from a plugin. What do I do? {#duplicates}

This indicates you have two versions of a plugin installed, or in different locations. Choose and delete one of the paths shown in your error. For example, Sapphire:

`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins\7.0\MediaCore\Sapphire Plug-ins`
`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins\7.0\MediaCore\BorisFX\Sapphire Plug-ins`

You can either delete one of these folders, though, consider removing both of them and reinstalling if you're attempting to upgrade a plugin to be safe.

### 12. I installed an extension (e.g. Flow) that appears in the list, but nothing happens when I click on it. {#CEP}

Ensure that the CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) is enabled.

**Windows:**

1. Close After Effects.
2. Download [**this file**](https://www.mediafire.com/file/g6pdj9v5xdyjkax/keys.reg/file) and run it.

**Mac:**

1. Close After Effects and open Terminal.
2. Copy and paste the text below:

```ts
defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.10 PlayerDebugMode 1
defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1
defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1
defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.13 PlayerDebugMode 1
```

1. Hit enter and you're done.

### 13. Generative AI is not working. Help! {#genAI}

AI Tools such as Generative Fill will not work on cracked versions of Photoshop due to the fact Adobe use a credit system for verification specifically for it. 


### 14. Missing CEP folder. {#missingcep}

Make sure your installation isn’t faulty, and that scripting and expressions are enabled in After Effects.

Open After Effects and enable “Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network”.

Windows: `Edit > Preferences > Scripting & Expressions`
 Mac: `After Effects > Preferences > Scripting & Expressions`

**Create the CEP folder manually:**


Go to the location below and create a **CEP** folder, and inside that CEP folder, create another folder named **extensions**.

Mac: `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/`
 Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe`

### 15. Magic Bullet Look presets not appearing same as the original coloring. {#_15-magic-bullet-look-presets-not-appearing-same-as-the-original-coloring}

Many Looks Builder tools were updated in the 2025 release, causing older presets to appear overexposured.

1. Open Looks Builder.
2. At the top at "In/Out Color Space", press the dropdown menu.
3. Select "1D sRGB (Video)"

## ⭐ Windows {#windows}

::: tip
Common questions and troubleshooting for issues on Windows.
:::

### 1. "Windows cannot complete the extraction. The destination file could not be created" {#winextract}

This error occurs if a file hasn't been properly extracted. Please follow the instructions written at the top of our Windows page regarding how to use 7-Zip.

### 2. "An unexpected error is keeping you from copying the file, Error 0x80004005" {#0x80004005}

This error occurs if a file hasn't been properly extracted. Please follow the instructions written at the top of our Windows page regarding how to use 7-Zip.

### 3. "The application was unable to start correctly (Oxc0000142). Click OK to close the application." {#0xc0000142}

Starting from version 24.1, **After Effects requires your processor to support Advanced Vector Extensions 2** or else the software will not launch.

If your processor does not support AVX2, **you'll need to downgrade to AE 2023 or lower**.

### 4. "The system cannot find the path specified." {#pathspecified}

Move the folder to your desktop and try again. If that does not work, remove the "/" symbol from the folder name if included.

### 5. Error Code: 24 (Adobe) {#code24}

- Extract the **iso** file itself (Right click > 7-Zip > Extract here)
- Temporarily turn off your internet.
- Open the extracted folder and run **Set-up.exe** again.

### 6. "AfterFX.exe - System Error. The code execution cannot proceed because MSVCP110.dll was not found." {#aesystemerror}

Your computer is missing necessary components. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2012: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) and restart your computer.

### 7. DaVinci Resolve Studio not starting (Windows). {#resolvesfailedstartup}

Rename OFX folder "Plugins" (`C:\Program Files\Common Files\OFX`) to "Plugins.origin".

### 8. "The installation cannot continue as the installer file may be damaged. Download the installer file again." {#windamaged}

This error occurs if a file hasn't been properly extracted. Please follow the instructions written at the top of our Windows page regarding how to use 7-Zip.

If it is properly extracted, it may mean you have leftovers from a previous installation. Use the official [Adobe Creative Cloud Cleaner Tool](https://swupmf.adobe.com/webfeed/CleanerTool/win/AdobeCreativeCloudCleanerTool.exe) to get rid of previous installations.

### 9. Error Code 127 (Adobe) {#wincode127}

[Error code 127](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/troubleshoot-download-install-logs#error127) indicates that the installer isn't able to extract the zip file in the `adobeTemp` folder. This can happen due to a lack of disk space or if the necessary permissions are unavailable. Sometimes, even antivirus software can block the extraction process in the temp directory.

1. Navigate to the `adobetemp` folder located at `\adobeTemp`. In the following example, the root drive is the C: drive.

::: tip TIP
If the folder doesn't exist, you can also create the folder.
:::

1. Right click anywhere on screen > **Properties**.
2. In the **Security** tab, ensure that permissions for **System** and **Administrators** have **Full Control**.
3. Turn off your antivirus temporarily or whitelist it.

### 10. "Patching Error - Pattern in Resolve. exe matched 0 times in .text section. Expected exactly 1." {#resolve-expected1}

This error occurs when a user mistakenly installs the free version of DaVinci Resolve and then runs our patch, which is intended for the **Studio** version. Ensure that you install the correct version.

### 11. Windows Defender is blocking an application from running and I don't know how to stop it? {#defenderblock}

You can either exclude or whitelist the file, disabling Defender completely is not recommended.

#### Exclude - video tutorial

1. Click the Windows key and write "Settings".
2. Go to Privacy & security > Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection.
3. Under Virus & threat protection settings, click "Manage settings".
4. Under Exclusions, click on "Add or remove exclusions".
5. Choose your installer/installation folder.

#### Whitelist - video tutorial

1. Open Virus & threat protection.
2. When the blocked file shows up under current threats, click it and on Action options, select "Allow on device".
3. Finalize decision by pressing "start actions".

### 12. I’m unable to launch specific games (e.g Valorant) after Adobe installation(s)? {#launchissues}

If after installation you start having problems with programs and games that worked fine before, simply delete the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\DevOverrideEnable
```

then reboot your system.

> If using GenP, you will have a toggle in-app for the Registry Key.

Certain games and other sensitive apps that use anti-cheat mechanisms may detect and flag DLL redirection as suspicious activity which may result in false positives.
